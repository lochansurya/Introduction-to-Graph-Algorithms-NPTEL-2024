## Topics Covered
| Week | Topics | Description |
| --- |-----|-----|
| 1| **Definition of Algorithm, Time Complexity, Asymptotic Analysis** | |
| 2| **Algorithms for Finding the Shortest Path in a Graph**| |
| 3|**Bellman Equations**| |
| 4|**Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms for SSSP**| |
| 5|**4 Algorithms for APSP : Bellman-Ford, Semi-Ring Matrix Multiplicaiton, Floyd-Warshall's, Johnsoon's Algorithm**| There is a notion of k-paths involved in Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for APSP. Johnson's Algorithm is better than Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm to solve APSP. Also, it is better for **sparse graphs**.|
