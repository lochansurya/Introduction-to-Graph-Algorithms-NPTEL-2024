## Topics Covered
| Week | Topics | Description |
| --- |-----|-----|
| 1| **Definition of Algorithm, Time Complexity, Asymptotic Analysis** | |
| 2| **Algorithms for Finding the Shortest Path in a Graph**| |
| 3|**Bellman Equations**| The base of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Covers the proofs and required foundation for Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Shortest Paths in a graph.|
| 4|**Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms for SSSP**| The Algorithms for Single Source Shortest Path(SSSP) problem, where the goal is to find the shortest path form a vertex to all other vertices in the graph.|
| 5|**4 Algorithms for APSP : Bellman-Ford, Semi-Ring Matrix Multiplicaiton, Floyd-Warshall's, Johnsoon's Algorithm**| There is a notion of k-paths involved in Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for APSP. Johnson's Algorithm is better than Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm to solve APSP. Also, it is better for **sparse graphs**.|
| 6|**Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithm - MST**| MST is the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree induced by all the vertices of the graph(undirected and connected). |
| 7|**DFS and Cut-Vertex**| An algorithm was introduced to find the cut vertex of a graph(undirected) by exploiting the **control points** of the DFS algorithm.|
| 8|**Strongly Connected Components(SCC), BFS**| Notion of Condensed DAG for SCC and the algorithm for finding the SCCs of a graph(undirected), and the Bradth-First Search. |
